				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p> I have a continue interests in technology as well as communication system. I enjoy coding and a self driven learner. I started with C++ since my 
				college and later I adopted various languages including JAVA, PHP , PYTHON, SWIFT and ANGULARJS. I like coding with Python the most and I found my new 
				favor swift language. I want to be a Full stack developer who can perform the mobile and web integration. With cloud service and server-less application, 
				The development process becomes so much simpler and the developer can explore the machines learning with which we can perform deeper research of big data.
				I am eager to explore possibility of cloud services.  </p>
